You can also set some fallback text if the plugin fails to find your codeblock:

    ```js reference title="Code with fallback"
    https://github.com/saucelabs/docusaurus-theme-github-codeblock
    This is some fallback text that will be displayed
    It can be multiline
    ```

    ```js reference title="If you dont have a fallback and the URL fails to load, it will show a message in your code block"
    https://github.com/saucelabs/docusaurus-theme-github-codeblock
    ```
